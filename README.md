# React - Webpack - Boilerplate

This repository is a starter point for projects based on a serverside rendered react setup.
It is under construction and i would not reccommend you to use this code directly on your production systems without reviewing it first.

Anyway feel free to have a look ask questions or tell me how to improve this setup.

For starting projects withoutout server side rendering i would recommend you to have a look at [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
